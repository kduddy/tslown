		<p>Thanks to my pal Don Alex for writing such a glowing review of my new book The Secret Life of Walter Newkirk Here is what Don posted on his Facebook page</p>
		<p>I want to highly recommend a new autobiography, "The Secret Life of Walter Newkirk".</p>
		<p>Walter's life story is fascinating. Ostracized by his family for being gay (and unashamed of it), he has gone through many ups and downs over the decades, from close friendships with Pat Loud (the matriarch of "An American Family"- the subjects of the very first "reality show") and Edie Beale (of "Grey Gardens" fame), to terrifying bouts of soul-crushing despair that were wrongly diagnosed as "manic depression" and that led to medication that he didnt need and that, in fact, made his condition much worse. He also demonstrates the joys and dangers of "one night stands" with strangers in a way that brings it home for those (like me) who have never had much experience with them.</p>
		<p>Far from being a book that will only have interest to gay people, he manages to convey the universality of human emotion that goes beyond one's personal orientation. As a heterosexual male, I was able to understand through his eyes and words how irrelevant that is to our common shared humanity. I have been through my own life troubles in the last few years (as those who have read my postings about it on Facebook know), including bouts of homelessness that nearly finished me off, but I have survived them and I am stronger than ever. So has Walter, and that triumph is the ultimate point of his book. Never give up, and don't let the bastards grind you down.</p>
		<p>This is an inspiring page-turner. I want to thank Walter for allowing me to be one of the first to read it. It was a privilege and an honor!</p>

		<h3 class="bold underline">What</h3>
		<p>Before shows like <span class="bold italic">“Modern Family”</span> and <span class="bold italic">“Will and Grace”</span> television historically did not portray gay characters.  In 1973 the first openly gay person in TV history was a real person - <span class="bold italic">LANCE LOUD</span> in the PBS series <span class="bold italic">“AN AMERICAN FAMILY”</span>.  The impact on gay people, of all ages hiding in the closet was profound.  Now a new book from one of those people, illuminating the struggle to break free from the oppression and bullying that threatened to destroy his life.</p>

		<h3 class="bold underline">Who</h3>
		<p>Author <span class="bold italic">WALTER NEWKIRK</span> rose to become a successful publicist even while his family medicated him to keep him quietly in the closet.  The story, often funny and shocking will have your audience laughing through their tears.   After being diagnosed with Type II diabetes, today he is free from those drugs, healthy and happy.  It is a story of triumph over great odds and this guest will regale you with hysterically funny stories about this long and winding road.  <a href="http://thesecretlifeofwalternewkirk.com">thesecretlifeofwalternewkirk.com</a></p>
