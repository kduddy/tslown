				<h1>praise for<br/>the secret life of walter newkirk</h1>


				<p>Walter Newkirk has written a thoughtful, humorous, and sometimes heartbreaking memoir chronicling a personal story of family,of love, of loss, and of personal growth and perserverance. Walter reminds us on page after page that life is not something simply to be lived. To be fully appreciated, life must be experienced."<br/><br/>-Richard Wesley, playwright/screenwriter<br/><span class="bold italic">The Mighty Gents, Native Son, Uptown Saturday Night, Let's Do It Again</span></p>

				<p>Walter Newkirk’s book is a fascinating memoir, a confession, an amusing and brutally honest look into the intimate life of a friend who has faced and overcome many obstacles, including family rejection and severe depression – and stands, happily, a survivor after enduring it all!<br/><br/>-Craig Highberger, author/filmmaker<br/><span class="bold italic">Superstar In A Housedress:  The LIfe and Legend of Jackie Curtis</span></p>

				<p>The Secret Life of Walter Newkirk is a wondrous, spellbinding memoir about growing up; describing events and influences that made an impression throughout Walter's life. The relatives, the childhood friends, through kindergarten and college,his downfalls and triumphs with writing about classic TV shows, the movies, the music he liked and played, made it very personal, sad, and funny in the same sentence. Grey Gardens, and An American Family are very important to Walter Newkirk... and me!<br/><br/>-Bob Esty, award-winning songwriter/producer<br/><span class="bold italic">Last Dance, The Main Event/Fight, Take Me Home</span></p>

				<p>My wife Betty met Walter Newkirk at a 2003 auction of Jackie Onassis' clothes and artifacts  before his first book was published.   The photo I took of Edie Beale is on the cover of his CD and the back cover of that book.  We are flattered  he wrote a chapter about us in this new book.  Walter is honest, straightforward,and funny. You must buy his book.  And that's an order from me - Ron Galella, papa of the paparazzi!"<br/><br/>-Ron Galella, photojournalist, author<br/><span class="bold italic">JACKIE: My Obsession</span></p>

				<p>Little Edie appreciated Walter Newkirk's honesty and intelligence when he interviewed her at Grey Gardens in 1976.   I was there. Edie would appreciate his honesty even more now that she is no longer here.  . It made me happy to learn his books about Little Edie are in the Harvard, Rutgers and Dartmouth University libraries. She would  be  proud of her Rutgers Boy and would  like  this new book as much as I do."<br/><br/>-Lois Wright, artist, author<br/><span class="bold italic">My Life At Grey Gardens:  13 Months and Beyond</span></p>

				<p>Everyone has a book in them! A story to tell. This is Walter's-zany, deep-cutting and crispy fried to the hide! Meeting Ron Galella and Betty "Bunny"through Walter was an experience, as were the rest of the Walter encounters including his passion for Little Edie and other artistic creatures on the East Coast:)<br/><br/>-Deborah Gregory, author<br/><span class="bold italic">The Cheetah Girls and Catwalk</span></p>

				<p>Walter Newkirk is a great guy. We worked together producing and editing some very creative videos back in the day.   He has an insane sense of humor, which definitely shines through in his profound new book.  I enjoyed reading it.<br/><br/>-Brian Cury, Founder/CEO<br/>EarthCam</p>

				<p>Walter Newkirk is someone with ethics and good judgment, maturity and reason. He shows empathy, respect and consideration for others. I highly recommend his new book<br/><br/>-Ralph W. Vogel, Executive Director<br/>Pride Center of Staten Island, Staten Island's LGBT Community Center</p>

				<p>It's not every man who, when remembering the 1964 World's Fair, has fond memories of the Clairol Change Your Hairdo Pavilion. Or on Halloween dressed as his Cub Scout den mother. Or was castigated by his seventh-grade teacher for wearing nail polish. Or worked for a urological catheter company. But that was Walter Newkirk, who grew up in an era where flamboyant homosexuality was still a social stigma. Here are laugh-inducing and pain-wincing stories of the progression from being sexually clueless, closeted, almost out and ragingly out with everyone from passers-by to priests.THE SECRET LIFE OF WALTER NEWKIRK is an orgy of Quaaludes, first-row seats at Bette Midler concerts, passing out in bathtubs, rubbing elbows with the cognac-swilling Sarah Vaughan but turning down the chance to bed Holly Woodlawn. Here's a book that will allow some readers to remember pop and political culture of the last four decades and introduce others to those crazy days of yore.<br/><br/>-Peter Filichia<br/>critic emeritus of <span class="bold italic">The Star-Ledger</span></p><br/>
